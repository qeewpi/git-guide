Here is an example workflow where you are working with two branches, `feature_a` and `feature_b`, and you want to use **rebasing** to keep `feature_b` up to date with the changes in `feature_a`.

### Scenario:
- You start by creating `feature_a` and do some work there.
- Then you create `feature_b` from `feature_a` to implement another feature.
- As work on `feature_a` continues, you want to keep `feature_b` updated with the latest changes in `feature_a` without repeatedly merging `feature_a` into `feature_b`. Instead, youâ€™ll **rebase**.

### Step-by-Step Example:

1. **Create and work on `feature_a`**:
   - Start by creating a new branch `feature_a` from `main` (or `master`):
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git checkout -b feature_a
     ```

   - Add some commits to `feature_a`:
     ```bash
     echo "Feature A work" > fileA.txt
     git add fileA.txt
     git commit -m "Add some work to feature_a"
     ```

2. **Create `feature_b` from `feature_a`**:
   - Now, create `feature_b` to implement another feature that depends on `feature_a`:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature_a
     git checkout -b feature_b
     ```

   - Add commits to `feature_b`:
     ```bash
     echo "Feature B work" > fileB.txt
     git add fileB.txt
     git commit -m "Start feature_b work"
     ```

3. **Work continues on `feature_a`**:
   - Meanwhile, someone (or you) adds more work to `feature_a`:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature_a
     echo "More feature A work" >> fileA.txt
     git add fileA.txt
     git commit -m "Add more work to feature_a"
     ```

   - Now, `feature_a` has progressed further, and `feature_b` is out of sync with the latest changes in `feature_a`.

4. **Rebase `feature_b` onto the updated `feature_a`**:
   - Instead of merging `feature_a` into `feature_b`, you rebase `feature_b` onto the latest version of `feature_a`:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature_b
     git rebase feature_a
     ```

   What this does:
   - Git will apply all the changes from `feature_b` on top of the latest `feature_a`.
   - You may have to resolve conflicts if there are any, but once the rebase is done, the history will look like `feature_b` was based on the newest version of `feature_a`.

5. **Continue work on `feature_b`**:
   - Now that `feature_b` is up to date, you can continue working on `feature_b`:
     ```bash
     echo "More feature B work" >> fileB.txt
     git add fileB.txt
     git commit -m "Continue work on feature_b"
     ```

6. **Merging `feature_a` into `main`**:
   - Eventually, you finish working on `feature_a`, and it gets merged into `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge feature_a
     git push origin main
     ```

7. **Rebase `feature_b` onto `main` (after `feature_a` is merged)**:
   - Now that `feature_a` is part of `main`, you want to make `feature_b` a standard branch based off `main` (since `feature_a` is already in `main`). You do this by rebasing `feature_b` onto `main`:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature_b
     git rebase --onto main feature_a feature_b
     ```

   What this does:
   - This command moves the base of `feature_b` from `feature_a` to `main`. All the commits in `feature_b` after `feature_a` will be applied **as if they were made on top of `main`**.

### Visualizing the Workflow:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```
   main
    |
    A---B---C     (feature_a)
         \
          D---E   (feature_b)
   ```

2. **After new work is done on `feature_a`**:
   ```
   main
    |
    A---B---C---F (feature_a)
         \
          D---E   (feature_b)
   ```

3. **After `feature_b` is rebased onto the latest `feature_a`**:
   ```
   main
    |
    A---B---C---F (feature_a)
                 \
                  D'---E'   (feature_b)
   ```

4. **After `feature_a` is merged into `main` and `feature_b` is rebased onto `main`**:
   ```
   main
    |
    A---B---C---F   (merged feature_a)
                  \
                   D'---E'   (feature_b, now based on `main`)
   ```

### Key Takeaways:
- **Rebasing `feature_b` onto `feature_a`** ensures that `feature_b` is always based on the most recent changes in `feature_a` without introducing merge commits.
- Once `feature_a` is merged into `main`, you can rebase `feature_b` onto `main`, which effectively "moves" the changes from `feature_b` onto `main` directly, as if they were originally made from `main`.
