# **Merging or Rebasing a Feature Branch into `17.0-dev`**

This guide outlines the steps to either merge or rebase changes from the `features/auto-suggestions-for-user-prompts` branch into the `17.0-dev` branch in Git.

## **Option 1: Merging Changes**

Merging retains the commit history from both branches and creates a merge commit.

### **Steps to Merge:**

1. **Switch to the `17.0-dev` branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout 17.0-dev
   ```

2. **Update `17.0-dev` with the latest remote changes**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin               # Fetch the latest changes from the remote
   git reset --hard origin/17.0-dev  # Reset local branch to match remote
   ```

3. **Merge the feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git merge features/auto-suggestions-for-user-prompts
   ```

4. **Resolve conflicts** (if any):
   - Manually resolve conflicts in the files indicated by Git.
   - Stage resolved files:
     ```bash
     git add <file>
     ```
   - Complete the merge:
     ```bash
     git commit
     ```

5. **Push the updated `17.0-dev` branch to the remote**:
   ```bash
   git push origin 17.0-dev
   ```

### **Example Merge Commit Message**:
```
Merge branch 'features/auto-suggestions-for-user-prompts' into '17.0-dev'
```

## **Option 2: Rebasing Changes**

Rebasing creates a linear commit history by replaying changes from the feature branch onto `17.0-dev`.

### **Steps to Rebase:**

1. **Switch to the feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout features/auto-suggestions-for-user-prompts
   ```

2. **Rebase onto the latest `17.0-dev`**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin               # Fetch the latest changes from remote
   git rebase origin/17.0-dev     # Rebase feature branch onto the latest 17.0-dev
   ```

3. **Resolve conflicts** (if any):
   - If conflicts arise, Git will pause the rebase process.
   - Resolve the conflicts in the affected files.
   - Stage resolved files:
     ```bash
     git add <file>
     ```
   - Continue the rebase:
     ```bash
     git rebase --continue
     ```

4. **Switch back to the `17.0-dev` branch** and fast-forward:
   ```bash
   git checkout 17.0-dev
   git merge features/auto-suggestions-for-user-prompts
   ```

5. **Push the updated `17.0-dev` branch to the remote**:
   ```bash
   git push origin 17.0-dev
   ```

### **Example Rebase Commit Message** (if applicable):
```
Rebased 'features/auto-suggestions-for-user-prompts' onto '17.0-dev'
```

## **Summary**
- Use **Merge** for preserving the commit history of both branches.
- Use **Rebase** for a clean, linear history without extra merge commits.
- Ensure to resolve any conflicts during both merge and rebase processes.
